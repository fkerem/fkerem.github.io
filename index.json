[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. Elisa Bertino. My research focuses on leveraging deep learning for network protocol reverse engineering. My broader research interests include network security, protocol reverse engineering, IoT security and privacy, systems and software security, and machine learning for security.\nMy work aims to analyze the security and privacy of communication protocols, particularly unknown or proprietary protocols, using deep learning techniques. I develop models and tools that systematically infer protocol structures and behaviors to enhance security analysis, anomaly detection, and formal verification. My research integrates concepts from machine learning, program analysis, and systems security to improve the robustness of protocol analysis frameworks.\nI earned both my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from Sabanci University. Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at Purdue University under the supervision of Dr. Z. Berkay Celik. During this internship, we developed a secure and robust context-based group pairing scheme for heterogeneous IoT devices. Our work, titled \u0026ldquo;One Key to Rule Them All: Secure Group Pairing for Heterogeneous IoT Devices\u0026rdquo;, was accepted to IEEE S\u0026amp;P 2023.\n  Download my resumé.\n","date":1684713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1676860116,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. Elisa Bertino.
