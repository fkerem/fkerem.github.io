My research interests include IoT security and privacy, wireless network security, systems security, web security, and adversarial machine learning.\nI received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from Sabanci University. In my master\u0026rsquo;s thesis, I implemented a data-driven intrusion detection system for 6LoWPAN based IoT systems under the supervision of Prof. Albert Levi.\nI also worked as a Research Intern at Purdue University under the supervision of Dr. Z. Berkay Celik. The aim of the internship was to develop security solutions for IoT systems. We implemented a secure and robust context-based sensor pairing scheme in the smart home/office context. Our study (One Key to Rule Them All: Secure Group Pairing for Heterogeneous IoT Devices) has been accepted to IEEE S\u0026amp;P 2023.\n  Download my resumé.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University under the supervision of Dr. Z.
